JavaScript: Data Types and Naming Conventions

Discussion

1. Reserved Keywords
JavaScript has about 64 reserved keywords, such as function, return, var, etc.

2. Naming Requirements and Conventions
Case-Sensitive: myVariable and myvariable are different.
Initial Character: Must start with a letter, $, or _.
Community Standard: camelCase is widely accepted.
The naming conventions are generally community standards and not enforced by the compiler.

3. Type System
JavaScript is dynamically typed; types are determined at runtime.

4. Strongly Typed or Weakly Typed?
JavaScript is weakly typed. It allows for type coercion.

5. Explicitly Typed or Implicitly Typed?
JavaScript is implicitly typed. The type of a variable is determined automatically.

6. Mutable or Immutable Variables?
Variables declared with let are mutable, while those declared with const are immutable.

7. Operators Available
Number: +, -, *, /, %
String: + (concatenation)
Boolean: &&, ||, !
Array: .push(), .pop()
Object: delete
8. Mixed Type Operations
Mixed type operations are allowed due to type coercion. For example, adding a string and a number converts the number to a string and then concatenates them.

9. Binding Time
In JavaScript, variables and operator symbols are bound at runtime due to its dynamic nature.

Illustrative Example
If you try x = "5" + 6; console.log(x);, JavaScript will output 56 because it coerces the number 6 into a string and performs concatenation.

10. Limitations
One of the biggest limitations is floating-point arithmetic errors due to binary floating-point format. Additionally, type coercion can lead to unexpected results.

11. Built-in Complex Types
JavaScript includes complex types like Set, Map, and Array.

Conclusion

This guide aimed to provide an in-depth understanding of JavaScript's data types, naming conventions, and other features. For more details, consult the MDN Web Docs.

To experiment with these features, you can run the example code in Node.js or any browser's JavaScript console.
