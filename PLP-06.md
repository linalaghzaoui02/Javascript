# Hangman Game

This Hangman game project aims to create an interactive word-guessing game using JavaScript. Below are the major components and the project timeline:

## Components

### User Interface (UI)
- Design and create a user-friendly UI that displays the Hangman game elements, including:
  - The hangman figure
  - The word to guess with underscores
  - Attempts left
  - Input fields for guessing letters
  - A "Play Again" button for replayability

### Word Selection
- Implement a word bank containing words for the game.
- Develop a function to choose a random word from the word bank for each new game.

### Game Logic
- Develop the core game logic to:
  - Handle user input
  - Check for correct guesses
  - Update the display
  - Keep track of attempts and game state

### Hangman Figure
- Implement the hangman figure using SVG graphics.
- Initially, the figure will be hidden, and parts of it will be revealed as the player makes incorrect guesses.

### End Game Handling
- Define conditions for ending the game, either by successfully guessing the word or running out of attempts.
- Display appropriate messages for winning and losing.

### Replay Functionality
- Provide users with the option to restart the game by clicking the "Play Again" button.

### Data Storage (Optional)
- Consider implementing the option to store high scores and user progress in a file or data structure, enhancing the game's replay value.

## Project Timeline

- **Week 1:** Set up the basic UI structure and start on using javascript to ensure backend is responsive with the frontend.
- **Week 2:**  create SVG graphics for the hangman figure and implement word selection and word display with underscores.
- **Week 3:** Develop the game logic for guessing letters and updating the display.
- **Week 4:** Handle end game conditions and implement replay functionality.
- **Week 5:** Final testing, debugging, and documentation.

## Project Duration

Based on the guideline of allocating approximately 6 hours per week for this project, it is estimated that within 30 hours, a fully functional and engaging Hangman game can be created. This timeframe allows for thorough development, testing, and documentation to ensure a polished and enjoyable user experience.

Feel free to contribute to this Hangman game project and have fun creating and playing it!
