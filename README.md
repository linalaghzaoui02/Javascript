# JavaScript Learning Journey

Welcome to my JavaScript learning repository! Here, I'm documenting my journey as I learn JavaScript from scratch using Visual Studio Code and Node.js. 

## Overview

JavaScript is a versatile programming language commonly used for web development. It allows you to create interactive and dynamic web applications.

## History

JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 while he was working at Netscape Communications Corporation. It was initially named "LiveScript" but later renamed to "JavaScript" to leverage the popularity of Java. JavaScript has since become one of the most widely used programming languages for both client-side and server-side development.

## Getting Started

To start working with JavaScript using Visual Studio Code and Node.js. I downloaded Node.js extension on VScode which allows you to run JavaScript outside the browser .

 Create a JavaScript File: In VSCode, create a new JavaScript file, e.g., `app.js`. This is where you'll write your JavaScript code.

### Hello World

Here's a simple "Hello World" program in JavaScript:

1. In my `hello.js` file, we type the following code:

   ```javascript
   // Print "Hello World!" to the console
   console.log("Hello World!");

   we could run it from both VSCODE with Run without debugging or the terminal typing ; node hello.js
